## Project
This project was created as part of the course "Advanced Topics in Reinforcement Learning" at TU Berlin in the WS22/23. It is based on the paper ["Cautious Adaptation For Reinforcement Learning in Safety-Critical Settings"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06622) by Zhang et al. (2020) and the corresponding [implementation](https://github.com/jesbu1/carl). The slightly modified repository for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/Safe-RL-Team/CARL-params).
